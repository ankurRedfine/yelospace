            <h4>1. What is Commercial Real Estate Subleasing?</h4>
            <p>Commercial Real Estate Subleasing is when the current tenant of a commercial space rents out a portion or all of their leased space to another party, known as the subtenant or sublessee. This arrangement allows the primary tenant to share the space and costs, while the sublessee gains access to a ready-to-use workspace without the long-term commitment of a traditional lease.</p>
